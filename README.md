VGtar - A Virtual Guitar Simulator
VGtar is an interactive, browser-based virtual guitar that allows you to play music in two distinct modes: Strumming and Plucking. Built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and the powerful Tone.js library for web audio, VGtar provides a realistic and feature-rich guitar-playing experience right in your web browser.
